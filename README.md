# Apple Website Clone
To fill my free time in the month of Ramadan, I made a project called Apple Website Clone.

This website was made in about 3 days, and this website was made using HTML, JavaScript and TailwindCSS. The purpose of this website is to train my front end skills. 

## Demo
To view the website click the link below 
https://kiizzki.github.io/Apple-Website-Clone/

## Features

- The website is fully responsive, optimized on 4k screens, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- It looks very similar to the original apple website in March 2024, including layout, typography, fonts and colors.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** HTML, Vanilla JavaScript, TailwindCSS

**Server:** none



Talk a little bit about the tools or tech that I use.
1. **HTML**<br>
As in general, HTML is used to create the structure and content of web pages.

2. **JavaScript**<br>
Vanilla JavaScript to make an accordion in the footer of the Mobile version. 

3. **TailwindCSS & CSS**<br>
And for styling, I use the TailwindCss framework and also use a little vanilla CSS because there are some things that I think are easier if styling in vanilla CSS.

4. **Resource**<br>
For the web resource, I took it from the apple website, I only took the image from there. For the font, I took it from [this](https://github.com/gattadesmond/hugo-foundation6/tree/master) repository.

That's it, Bye
